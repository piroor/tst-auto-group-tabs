## Author's comment from @piroor

I'm finding successor developers of the "TST Auto Group Tabs" project. I'm ready to transfer the ownership of this project to successors.

I generally use TST without this kind features.
This is the reason why I decided to separate these features from TST to a helper addon.

From the same reason, sorry but I have less motivation to develop and maintain this project.
I believe that this project should be owned by someone who really want to use it.
If you are interested to take the ownership of this project, please contact me via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/piroor/tst-auto-group-tabs/issues) or [email](mailto:piro.outsider.reflex@gmail.com).
